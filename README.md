# Smart-Home
Smart Home Project using PIC18F4620 microcontroller / C language

• temperature monitoring and control using I2C communication 
between master and slave PICs. 
• Implemented real-time temperature display, motor control, and EEPROM storage for persistence. 
• Integrated DS1307 RTC module for date and time tracking, with UART communication for system 
updates.
